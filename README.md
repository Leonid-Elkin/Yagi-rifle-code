# Yagi-rifle-code
The code for my yagi antenna and radar module

For the national competition CANSAT. My job was to set up ground communications to our 'sattelite'. For this I made a 14.5 gain 868MHz yagi antenna. After finishing it early, I desided it would be useful to measure distance between me and the can using the delay between radio wave travel. 
Im using a gyroscope, lcd display, rf solutions radio chip all controlled with a rasberry pi. This is my code for it.
