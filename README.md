	# Yagi-rifle-code
The code for my Yagi antenna and radar module

For the national competition CANSAT, my job was to set up ground communications for our 'satellite'. For this, I made a 14.5-gain 868MHz Yagi antenna. After finishing it early, I decided it would be useful to measure the distance between me and the can using the delay between radio wave travel. 
I used a gyroscope, LCD, and RF solutions radio chip, all controlled with a Raspberry Pi. This is my code for it.
